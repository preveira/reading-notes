 **Growth Mindset**

To me **Growth Mindset** is all about how we choose to frame our minds. Whether we choose to be **bold** and live life without fear of the unknown or whether we choose to be *timid* and shy away from challenges or things that scare us. Embracing a true **"Growth Mindset"** is really about getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.

My **Growth Mindset** reminders:
1. Stay Positive through grattitude
2. Continue tending the garden of my mind
3. Understand that failure doesn't exists, only lessons in life
