1. **What is a “component”?**
   In React, a component is a reusable building block that encapsulates a piece of user interface and its behavior. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements that allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each responsible for its own rendering and functionality.

2. **What are the characteristics of a component?**
   - Reusability: Components can be reused throughout an application, which promotes modularity and reduces redundancy in code.
   - Encapsulation: Components encapsulate their own logic and state, allowing for better organization and maintenance of code.
   - Composability: Components can be composed together to build more complex UIs, creating a hierarchical structure.
   - Separation of Concerns: Components separate different concerns of the UI, such as presentation, logic, and state management, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
   - Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing duplication of code and promoting consistency.
   - Maintainability: Components encapsulate their own logic and state, making it easier to understand, test, and modify individual pieces of code without affecting other parts of the application.
   - Scalability: Component-based architecture allows for the development of large, complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - Collaboration: Components promote collaboration among developers by providing a clear structure and interface for building UI elements.

4. **What is “props” short for?**
   "Props" is short for properties.

5. **How are props used in React?**
   Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are immutable and are passed down the component tree in a unidirectional flow.

6. **What is the flow of props?**
   In React, props flow in a unidirectional manner, from parent components to child components. This means that data can be passed down from a parent component to its children, but cannot be directly modified by the child components. This unidirectional flow helps maintain a clear data flow and ensures that the application remains predictable and easier to debug.
