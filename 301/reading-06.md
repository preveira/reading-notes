**To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**
When I worked for the Coast Guard I had no psychological safety so it was hard to express actual feeling and thoughts on operations and happenings regardless of how much it might have bothered me or not.

**How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**
It helps me to keep in the fore-front of my mind that everyone should feel supported and safe to express themselve as themselves. Not ever feeling liek they need to hide or be something/someone they aren't.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
   - The techniques used in the class are not suitable for communicating with all machines globally because they were not designed with that purpose in mind. The techniques were developed to communicate with a small group of machines, whereas the requirements for global communication were different when the web was being built.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
   - The HTTP protocol, which Roy Fielding and his colleagues created, stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP is capable of describing the location of resources anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.

**What does a GET do?**
   - A GET request is an HTTP method used to retrieve data from a specified resource. When you enter a URL into a web browser, it sends a GET request to the server to fetch the resource (e.g., a web page), and the server responds by sending back the requested data.

**What does a POST do?**
   - A POST request is an HTTP method used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is commonly used to send form data to a server for processing, such as submitting a web form or uploading a file.

**What does PUT do?**
   - A PUT request is an HTTP method used to update a resource on the server with the data provided in the request payload. It replaces the existing resource with the new data sent in the request.

**What does PATCH do?**
   - A PATCH request is an HTTP method used to apply partial modifications to a resource on the server. Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH is used to apply partial updates, making it more efficient for updating large resources.
