1. What is a ‘call’?
A 'call' in programming refers to the invocation of a function or method.

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
The number of 'calls' that can happen simultaneously depends on factors such as the programming language, hardware resources, and system architecture.

3. What does LIFO mean?
LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It's a principle commonly associated with data structures like stacks, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
A Stack Overflow occurs when the call stack exceeds its maximum size, typically due to an excessive number of function calls or recursive function calls without proper termination conditions.

6. What is a ‘reference error’?
A 'reference error' occurs when code attempts to access a variable that does not exist or is not in scope.

7. What is a ‘syntax error’?
A 'syntax error' is an error that occurs when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language, making it impossible to interpret or execute.

8. What is a ‘range error’?
A 'range error' occurs when a value is not within the accepted range of values, often in relation to array indices or function arguments.

9. What is a ‘type error’?
A 'type error' occurs when an operation is performed on a value of a type that is not compatible with the operation.

10. What is a breakpoint?
A 'breakpoint' is a point in the code where execution will temporarily pause, allowing the programmer to inspect the program's state.

11. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
A 'debugger' is a tool used by programmers to debug their code. It allows them to pause execution, inspect variables, and step through the code line by line to identify and fix errors.
