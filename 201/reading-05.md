**What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**

**Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
The <figure> element in HTML is useful when you have content, such as an image or a diagram, that is referenced in the main content but needs additional context, such as a caption. The <figure> element is often used in combination with the <figcaption> element to provide a caption for the associated content

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
**GIF Image:**
A GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) image is like a series of pictures put together to create a short, animated clip. It's similar to those flipbooks we used to make, where each page had a slightly different drawing, and when you flipped through them quickly, it looked like the drawing was moving. In the same way, a GIF is a collection of pictures that play in a loop, creating a simple animation. GIFs are good for small, simple animations like smiley faces winking or a waving flag.

**SVG Image:**
Now, an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image is a bit different. Instead of being a bunch of pictures, it's more like a set of instructions for a drawing. It's like having a recipe for a cake, but for pictures. SVG images use mathematical equations to describe shapes and colors, which means they can be resized without losing quality. So, if you want to zoom in on a picture without it getting blurry, SVG is great for that. SVG is like having a magical drawing recipe that can be as big or small as you want, and it always looks good.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
PNG for high-quality screenshots with transparency needs, and choose JPEG for smaller file sizes when a slight loss in quality is acceptable.

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
In simple terms, foreground color is about the color of the words or content you see, and background color is about the color of the space around those words or content.

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**
Start by selecting a cohesive color scheme. This includes a primary color and complementary colors that work well together. Websites often use a combination of two or three main colors along with neutral tones.
Consider the mood you want to convey. Warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) can create a lively and energetic feel, while cool colors (blues, greens, purples) can give a calm and professional impression. Once you have that Color scheme then deploy it throughout the website evenly.

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**
-Readability: Prioritize readability over style.
-Font Size: Ensure the font size is appropriate for various devices.
-Font Style and Tone: Choose fonts that match the style and tone of your website.

-Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test fonts across different browsers.
