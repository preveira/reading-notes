**Explain why we need domain modeling.**
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**
Instead of tables, web developers are encouraged to use semantic HTML elements like <div>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <nav>, and others for layout purposes. CSS can then be used to style and position these elements, providing a cleaner, more maintainable, and semantically meaningful structure to web pages.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.**
<head>
<body>
<footer>

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a constructor is a special method or function that is automatically called when an object is instantiated or created from a class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes or properties and perform any setup actions that are necessary for the object to be in a valid and usable state.

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
in an object literal, "this" refers to the object itself, while in a constructor, "this" refers to the specific instance of the object being created. Understanding the context in which "this" is used is crucial for proper manipulation of object properties and methods in JavaScript.

**Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**
I have IT sys admin experience and in the realm of server administration, prototypes are like templates defining common configurations, and inheritance allows for the creation of specialized instances with the flexibility to inherit and customize settings. This analogy illustrates how changes at different levels (global, prototype, instance) can affect the entire server infrastructure, highlighting the principles of prototypes and inheritance in a familiar IT context.
