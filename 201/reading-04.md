**What is meant by “normal flow”?**
In CSS, "normal flow" refers to the default layout behavior that elements follow when no positioning or floating is applied to them. In the normal flow, elements are laid out in the document in the order they appear in the HTML, with each block-level element starting on a new line.

**What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**
Block-level elements: Start on a new line and take up the full width available. They create a block or box in the layout.
Inline elements: Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content and do not create a new block.

**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
Static positioning

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
Precise Placement, Independent from Normal Flow, Responsive Design and Relative to Containing Block.

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
 the key difference is that fixed positioning is relative to the viewport, and the element remains fixed even when scrolling, while absolute positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

 **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
 A function declaration is a way to define a function in JavaScript.
