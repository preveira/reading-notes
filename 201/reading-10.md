**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
syntax errors deal with the correct structure of the code, while logic errors involve mistakes in the program's algorithm or flow, leading to unexpected results. Syntax errors are usually caught during compilation, while logic errors may only become apparent during runtime.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
When I ran into Syntax errors I was able to identify them withim VsCode through the error notification or within the web browsers console. Once I was aware of the error I went back to the line that was referenced in the error and corrected either the parenthesis, quotation mark or undefined variable.

I've also ran into syntax errors when mispelling words or functions that need to be repeated for invocation or use later in the code. Correction is to fix the misspelling.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
I guess it will influence my long term goals by needing to be more aware of the misatakes that can cause certain errors and being as cautious as I possibly can not to make those mistakes or at least know how to identify and fix them when they do occur (which they almost always will).

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
Accessing the Debugger:
Most web browsers have built-in Developer Tools. You can open them by right-clicking on a webpage, selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," and navigating to the "Console" or "Debugger" tab.

Setting Breakpoints:
A breakpoint is a point in your code where you want the execution to pause, allowing you to inspect variables, the call stack, and the program's state.
Click on the line number in your code editor next to the line where you want to set a breakpoint. Alternatively, you can set breakpoints directly in the browser's Developer Tools.

Running the Debugger:
Once breakpoints are set, run your JavaScript code. When the execution reaches a breakpoint, it pauses, and control is handed over to the debugger.

Inspecting Variables:
While paused at a breakpoint, you can inspect the values of variables by hovering over them or checking the variables panel in the debugger.
This allows you to see the current state of your program at that point in the code.

Stepping Through Code:
The debugger provides options to step through your code line by line. You can use "Step Into," "Step Over," and "Step Out" to navigate through functions and understand the flow of your program.

Call Stack:
The call stack shows you the chain of function calls that led to the current point in the code. It helps you understand the sequence of events and how functions are nested.

Console Output:
The console within the Developer Tools is valuable for logging messages from your code. You can use console.log() statements to output information and debug messages.

Fixing Issues:
As you identify issues through the debugger, you can make necessary adjustments to your code and continue debugging until the program behaves as expected.
