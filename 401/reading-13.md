1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

   The Chat Example is an application that enables real-time communication between users over the internet. Users can exchange text messages instantly without needing to refresh the page. It utilizes technologies like Socket.IO to facilitate this communication, providing a seamless chatting experience.

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

   From the backend, we're receiving proof that the connections between clients and the server are active and responsive. This proof of life typically includes signals indicating that clients are connected, disconnected, or performing actions like sending messages.

3. Socket.IO gives us the io.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

   To send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket, you would use the `broadcast` flag. Specifically, `io.emit('event', data)` sends the event to all connected clients, whereas `socket.broadcast.emit('event', data)` sends the event to all clients except the one that triggered the event.

4. What is a room and how might a room be useful?

   A room is a feature in Socket.IO that allows you to group sockets together. It's useful for organizing users based on specific criteria, such as topic of discussion, user type, or any other relevant attribute. Rooms enable targeted communication within subsets of users, making it easier to manage and scale applications.

5. How do you join a room?

   To join a room, a socket simply needs to call the `join` method and provide the name of the room as a parameter. For example: `socket.join('roomName')`. Once joined, the socket becomes part of that room and can receive messages sent specifically to that room.

6. How do you leave a room?

   Leaving a room is as simple as calling the `leave` method on the socket and providing the name of the room to leave. For example: `socket.leave('roomName')`. Once the socket leaves the room, it will no longer receive messages specifically targeted to that room.

7. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

   A Namespace in Socket.IO is a way to separate concerns within the same WebSocket connection. It allows you to define multiple communication channels or endpoints within a single server instance. Each Namespace operates independently, enabling you to customize behavior and manage connections differently for different parts of your application.

8. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

   Each namespace potentially has its own sockets, rooms, and events. These elements are scoped to the specific namespace, providing isolation and organization for different parts of the application.

9. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces.

   Separate namespaces can be beneficial for applications that require different types of real-time communication. For example, in a multiplayer online game, you might have separate namespaces for different game modes or features (e.g., chat, gameplay, matchmaking). Each namespace can have its own set of rules, events, and rooms tailored to the specific functionality it supports, providing a clean and modular architecture.
