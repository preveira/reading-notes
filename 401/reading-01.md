**1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**
   Node is like a playground where JavaScript can run outside of a web browser. Just like how you use JavaScript to make websites interactive, with Node, you can use JavaScript to build all sorts of applications, from servers to command-line tools.

**2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
   Saying Node is a JavaScript runtime means that it's a program that executes JavaScript code. Think of it as a stage where your JavaScript code performs its actions. Node allows you to run JavaScript on your computer/server rather than just in a web browser.

**3. What is Node used for?**
   Node is used for building various types of applications, such as web servers, command-line tools, APIs, and even desktop applications. It's particularly popular for creating server-side applications because it allows developers to write both the frontend and backend of a web application in JavaScript, making the development process more cohesive and efficient.

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
I look forward to learning more about how to test if my code is working properly with tools like Jest.

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
I would like to be a confident Full-stack software enginner by the end of the course.
