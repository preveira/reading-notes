**1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is the `events` module. It provides an EventEmitter class which allows us to create objects that emit named events that can be listened for and acted upon.

**2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

The value of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) used in tandem with Event Driven Programming lies in the organization and encapsulation of code. OOP allows us to create classes and objects that represent real-world entities and concepts, making our code more modular, maintainable, and scalable. When combined with Event Driven Programming, OOP enables us to create event handlers and listeners as methods of objects, facilitating clear and structured event handling.

**3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

Imagine you're planning a surprise birthday party for your friend. You've got multiple tasks to manage: sending out invitations, decorating the venue, preparing food, and arranging entertainment. Each of these tasks needs to happen at the right time, and you need to be ready to react to unexpected situations, like a last-minute change in the party location or unexpected weather.

   Event Driven Programming in the web browser is like having a party planner who listens for events and reacts accordingly. For example, when a guest RSVPs to the invitation, the planner takes note of it and updates the guest list. If it starts raining during the outdoor party, the planner quickly changes the location to indoors.

   Now, think about Event Driven Programming on the backend using Node.js. In this scenario, your Node.js application acts as the party planner for your server. It listens for incoming requests (events) from clients, such as web browsers or mobile apps. When a request comes in, the application triggers event handlers to process the request, whether it's fetching data from a database, performing calculations, or sending a response back to the client.

   Just like the party planner, your Node.js application needs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and respond to events in real-time. Event Driven Programming in Node.js allows your application to efficiently manage these tasks, handle asynchronous operations, and scale to handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it ideal for building responsive and scalable backend systems.
