**What is an EC2 Instance?**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a cloud-based service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides resizable compute capacity. It allows you to rent virtual servers (instances) to run applications, host websites, and perform various other computing tasks. EC2 is designed for flexibility and scalability, letting users choose from a wide range of configurations and pay only for the resources they use.

**Name 2 use cases for EC2.**
1. **Hosting Websites and Web Applications**: EC2 instances can be used to host websites, web applications, and APIs. This is particularly useful for scalable and high-availability applications.
2. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: EC2 is ideal for running data analysis, big data processing, and machine learning tasks. You can deploy large instances with high CPU and GPU resources for intensive computations.

**Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.**
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) provides more flexibility and control over containerized workloads than services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com. ECS allows you to manage clusters of instances and offers tighter integration with other AWS services, providing more control over the infrastructure, networking, and scaling. This is beneficial for complex architectures and microservices.

**Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?**
EC2 can be found in the AWS Management Console by selecting "Services" in the navigation bar and then choosing "EC2" from the list. Alternatively, you can search for "EC2" in the search bar at the top of the console.

**Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.**
The general difference between T2 Micro and XL is the size and capacity of the instances:
- **T2 Micro** is a smaller instance with fewer resources, designed for low-traffic workloads or development environments. It provides burstable CPU performance, allowing you to use extra CPU when needed, but within a certain limit.
- **T2 XL** (like T2.xlarge) is a much larger instance with more resources, suitable for higher-traffic workloads, larger applications, or more demanding tasks. It has more CPU power, memory, and network capacity.

**Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.**
A "Compute Cycle" can be thought of as the basic unit of work that a computer processor (CPU) performs. Imagine a person reading a book. Each time they read a sentence, that's like a compute cycle—the smallest task the processor can do. Many cycles together make up the work a computer does, like reading the whole page or chapter. The more cycles a processor has, the more work it can do in a shorter time.

**What is Elastic Beanstalk?**
Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. It handles the infrastructure, including provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring, allowing you to focus on developing your application. Elastic Beanstalk supports several platforms, including Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, and Docker.

**Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.**
Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances as the underlying infrastructure to deploy and run your applications. It abstracts much of the complexity of managing EC2 instances by automatically provisioning, scaling, and managing them. Elastic Beanstalk provides a simplified interface for deploying applications while leveraging the power and flexibility of EC2.

**Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.**
1. **Simplified Deployment**: Elastic Beanstalk automates deployment, scaling, and monitoring, reducing the complexity of managing infrastructure.
2. **Scalability**: It automatically scales your application based on demand, adding or removing EC2 instances as needed.
3. **Integration with Other AWS Services**: Elastic Beanstalk integrates with various AWS services, like Amazon RDS (for databases) and Amazon S3 (for storage), allowing you to build complex applications with ease.
4. **Multi-platform Support**: It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it flexible for different application types.
5. **Cost-effective**: You pay for the underlying resources, like EC2 instances, without additional costs for Elastic Beanstalk, making it a cost-effective solution for many applications.
