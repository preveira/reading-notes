Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.
 Here's two ideas I had for this:
**Collaborative task management system:** Build a collaborative task management platform where users can create, assign, and track tasks in real-time using Node.js and event-driven architecture. Events could be triggered when tasks are created, assigned, completed, or modified, allowing for seamless collaboration among team members.

**Automated stock trading platform:** Develop an automated stock trading platform that reacts to market events in real-time using Node.js and event-driven design. Similar to package delivery events, this platform could emit events when certain market conditions are met, triggering buy or sell orders for stocks or other financial instruments.
