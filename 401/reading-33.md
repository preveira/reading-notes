1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. It assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users. This allows administrators to manage user permissions more efficiently by grouping users with similar roles and assigning them the same set of permissions.

2. Share an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

Let's consider a simple example of RBAC in a content management system:

Roles:
- Admin
- Editor
- Viewer

Permissions:
- Create: Allows creating new content
- Read: Allows viewing existing content
- Update: Allows modifying existing content
- Delete: Allows deleting existing content

Corresponding Permissions:
- Admin: All CRUD operations
- Editor: Create, Read, Update
- Viewer: Read only

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

RBAC offers several benefits:
- Simplified Management: Roles are easier to manage than individual permissions for each user.
- Enhanced Security: Access is based on roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- Scalability: RBAC scales well with organizations as they grow, making it easier to add or modify user permissions.
- Compliance: RBAC helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements by ensuring proper access control.

4. Describe some react-cookie features.

React Cookie is a library for handling browser cookies in React applications. Some of its features include:
- Simple API: React Cookie provides a straightforward API for setting, getting, and deleting cookies in React components.
- Lightweight: It's a lightweight library with minimal dependencies, making it easy to integrate into React projects.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: React Cookie supports all major browsers and provides consistent behavior across different environments.

5. Describe some react-cookies features.

React Cookies is another library for handling cookies in React applications. Some of its features include:
- Easy Integration: React Cookies seamlessly integrates with React applications, providing a simple API for managing cookies.
- Support for Server-Side Rendering: React Cookies supports server-side rendering, allowing cookies to be set and accessed on both the client and server.
- TypeScript Support: It offers TypeScript support out of the box, making it easier to work with type-safe code.

6. Which library would you prefer? Why?

The choice between React Cookie and React Cookies depends on the specific requirements of the project and personal preferences. If I need a lightweight solution with a simple API and minimal dependencies, I might prefer React Cookie. On the other hand, if I require server-side rendering support or TypeScript integration, React Cookies would be a better choice. Ultimately, I would evaluate the features and compatibility of each library based on the project's needs.
