### Building Blocks of React
- **What forms the basic structure of a React application?**
  - Components.

- **How do HTML elements differ from React components?**
  - HTML elements are static and cannot run JavaScript, while React components are dynamic and can execute JavaScript.

### JSX in React
- **What is JSX, and why is it useful in React?**
  - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

- **How do you embed JavaScript expressions within JSX?**
  - By placing the JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}`.

- **Does JSX have any unique features for loops or conditional statements?**
  - No significant differences compared to regular JavaScript for loops and conditionals.

### React and User Interaction
- **How does React handle user input?**
  - React uses state to manage and track user input.

- **What keyword typically indicates that a React component is using a Hook to manage state?**
  - `useState`.

- **How do you share data between two React components?**
  - By passing data through `props` from one component to another.

### Refreshing React UI
- **What are the stages involved in updating a React UI?**
  - The three stages are: triggering, rendering, and committing.

- **How do you trigger a component update after the initial render?**
  - By updating the component's state.

- **Does React re-create DOM nodes every time it re-renders?**
  - No, React only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed.

- **After React updates the DOM, what still needs to occur before the user can see the updated UI?**
  - The browser needs to repaint the changes onto the screen.

### Learning Resources and Additional Questions
- **What do you notice about the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide?**
  - The naming conventions are designed to be consistent and easily readable.

- **What are you looking forward to learning in the upcoming course module?**
  - I'm excited about learning React Native because it allows me to understand mobile app development.

- **What are your learning goals after reviewing the course material?**
  - Iâ€™m interested in how components can load their own CSS, and today's discussion on TypeScript piqued my curiosity as well.
