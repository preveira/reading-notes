### What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit addresses several common concerns in Redux development, such as reducing boilerplate code, simplifying store configuration, and managing immutable updates more easily. It provides tools that integrate best practices by default, making Redux setup and maintenance more efficient and less error-prone.

### What does configureStore() do?

`configureStore()` is a function from Redux Toolkit that sets up a Redux store with good defaults. It includes middleware for handling asynchronous actions, enables the Redux DevTools Extension for debugging, and incorporates middleware for better error handling and performance checks, simplifying the overall store configuration process.

### How would I use createSlice()?

`createSlice()` is a function in Redux Toolkit used to define a slice of the Redux state. It involves specifying a name for the slice, the initial state, and an object of reducer functions. Each reducer function details how the state should change in response to actions. `createSlice()` automatically generates corresponding action creators and action types based on these reducer functions.

### What is MobX?

MobX is a state management library for JavaScript applications that enables reactive programming. It simplifies managing and updating application state by using observable state, computed values, and reactions, focusing on making state management both simple and scalable.

### How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

MobX ensures consistent state by leveraging reactive programming principles. It automatically tracks dependencies, so when an observable value changes, all derived values and reactions are updated atomically and consistently. This automatic propagation of state changes prevents inconsistencies, keeping the application state synchronized.

### How would we build a reactive user interface?

To build a reactive user interface with MobX, follow these steps:

1. **Define Observable State**: Use `observable` to define the state that MobX will manage.
2. **Create Actions**: Define methods that modify the state and mark them as `action`.
3. **Computed Values**: Define derived values using `computed`, which automatically update when their dependencies change.
4. **React to Changes**: Use `observer` from `mobx-react` to make React components automatically update in response to changes in observable state.

This approach ensures that the UI updates automatically in response to state changes, providing a reactive and consistent user experience.
