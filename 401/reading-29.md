1. **What is the motivation for adding a reducer?**
   The motivation for adding a reducer is to manage complex state logic in a more predictable and scalable manner. Reducers provide a structured way to handle multiple state transitions based on specific actions, allowing for easier debugging, testing, and code maintainability. This approach is particularly useful when the state has multiple sub-values or requires complex transitions that depend on prior state or action types.

2. **What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?**
   Actions in the context of a reducer are objects that represent a specific state change or event. They typically contain a type property that describes the nature of the action, along with optional additional data. Unlike setting state directly (e.g., using `setState` in React), actions allow for a clear separation of concerns. Reducers use these actions to determine how to update the state, ensuring a more predictable state transition flow and reducing the risk of unintended side effects.

3. **What common list operation is useReducer named for, and why?**
   The common list operation that useReducer is named for is the "reduce" function. In programming, reduce is a higher-order function that processes an array of items, accumulating a result through repeated application of a function. In the context of useReducer, this function (the reducer) processes a series of actions to derive a final state, much like the reduce operation in array processing. It emphasizes the concept of deriving a state by applying transformations over time.

4. **When should you switch from useState to useReducer?**
   You should consider switching from useState to useReducer when the state logic becomes complex or involves multiple related values. Specific scenarios include:
   - When state transitions require multiple conditions or complex logic.
   - When managing state across several related components.
   - When your state updates are driven by distinct actions or events.
   - When you need a more structured approach to handle state, potentially with a reducer function for testability or predictability.
