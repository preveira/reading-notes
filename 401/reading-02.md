1. **Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.**

   Middleware acts as a bridge between different software applications, kind of like a mediator. It's like the glue that helps different parts of a system communicate and work together smoothly. Imagine it as the middleman who ensures that requests from one part of a system are properly handled and then passed on to the next part.

2. **Express the most popular __ __ ____.**

   Express is the most popular web application framework for Node.js. It's widely used by developers to build web applications and APIs because of its simplicity and flexibility.

3. **Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?**

   When we say Express is "unopinionated," it means that it doesn't impose strict rules or guidelines on how you should structure your application. Instead, it gives you the freedom to make decisions based on your specific needs. This flexibility allows developers to design their applications in a way that best suits their project requirements.

4. **What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?**

   A module is a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific task. Modularity refers to the practice of breaking down a program into smaller, manageable modules. This approach makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. It also promotes collaboration among developers by allowing them to work on different modules independently.

5. **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

    Version: 10.5.0

6. **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?**

   To install the 'jshint' library/package into your Node.js project, you would use the following command:
   ```
   npm install jshint
   ```

7. **Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non-technical elder.**

   Tests are crucial because they ensure that the software we build works as expected. Just like how we check the brakes of a car before driving, tests help us catch and fix any potential issues in our code before they cause problems for users. They provide peace of mind and confidence that our software is reliable and safe to use.

8. **What are three expected benefits of testing?**

   Three benefits of testing are:
   - **Reliability:** Testing helps ensure that the software behaves as intended under different conditions, reducing the likelihood of unexpected failures.
   - **Maintainability:** Tests serve as documentation for how the code should function, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code in the future.
   - **Cost-effectiveness:** Detecting and fixing bugs earlier in the development process is generally less expensive than addressing them later, saving time and resources.

9. **Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.**

   Individual pitfalls:
   - **Over-reliance on happy paths:** Focusing only on scenarios where everything works perfectly may lead to overlooking edge cases and potential failure points.
   - **Testing without understanding:** Writing tests without a clear understanding of the requirements and underlying code can result in ineffective or redundant tests.

   Team pitfalls:
   - **Lack of communication:** Inconsistent testing practices among team members can lead to confusion and make it difficult to maintain the test suite.
   - **Not prioritizing testing:** When testing is deprioritized, there's a higher risk of delivering low-quality software, which can erode trust and confidence in the team's work.

10. **What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?**

    Three benefits of Continuous Integration are:
   - **Faster feedback:** CI detects integration errors early in the development process, allowing developers to fix them immediately, which leads to faster development cycles.
   - **Reduced risk:** By frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository and running automated tests, CI helps identify and address issues before they escalate, reducing the risk of major failures.
   - **Improved collaboration:** CI encourages collaboration among team members by promoting a shared codebase and providing visibility into changes made by individual developers.

11. **What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

    Continuous Delivery involves automatically deploying code changes to a testing or staging environment after successful integration and testing. However, the final deployment to production is done manually. Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, goes a step further by automatically deploying code changes to production after successful integration and testing, without human intervention.

12. **Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.**

    GitHub is like a central hub for storing and managing code. Think of it as a big digital filing cabinet where developers can keep track of different versions of their code. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes. GitHub also provides tools for collaboration, such as issue tracking and pull requests, which help streamline communication and review of code changes. Overall, it makes the process of working on software projects smoother and more organized.

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
I am eager to learm about Express Middleware and what that does.
